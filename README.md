## Quick Start

### Docker Compose (recommended)

```yaml
services:
  nextDash:
    image: ghcr.io/jordibrouwer/nextdash:latest
    container_name: nextDash
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    environment:
      PORT: "8080"
      NEXTDASH_ADMIN_USERNAME: ${NEXTDASH_ADMIN_USERNAME:-admin}
      NEXTDASH_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH: ${NEXTDASH_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH:?Set it in .env}
      NEXTDASH_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE: "1"
      NEXTDASH_WRITE_TOKEN: ${NEXTDASH_WRITE_TOKEN:-}
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Generate the mandatory administrator password hash, then save it in an ignored `.env` file:

```sh
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/jordibrouwer/nextdash:latest hash-password
```

```dotenv
NEXTDASH_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
# Single quotes keep every $ in the PHC string literal.
NEXTDASH_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH='$argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=3,p=2$...$...'
# Required only for the browser extension; use a long random value.
NEXTDASH_WRITE_TOKEN=change-me-to-a-long-random-string
```

When started from source with `go run .` or the compiled binary, nextDash automatically reads `.env` from the current working directory. Existing process environment variables take precedence, and values such as the Argon2 PHC string are kept literal without `$` expansion. A malformed `.env` stops startup with a line-numbered error. Docker Compose reads the same file itself.

Production requires HTTPS. For local plain-HTTP development only, set `NEXTDASH_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=0`.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

**Build from a git checkout:** use `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production (only `./data` is mounted; CSS/JS come from the image). Use `docker-compose.yml` for development (mounts `./static` and `./templates` so changes apply without rebuild).

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

### Build from source

```sh
go build -o nextDash && ./nextDash
```

By default, data is stored in `./data`. Override with `NEXTDASH_DATA_DIR` (absolute or relative path) when you need a separate data location.

---

## Security

nextDash now has **mandatory single-administrator authentication**. Startup fails closed when `NEXTDASH_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` is missing, malformed, or requests excessive Argon2 resources. There is no open compatibility mode.

- Username: `NEXTDASH_ADMIN_USERNAME` (default `admin`).
- Password: an Argon2id PHC hash in `NEXTDASH_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`.
- Session: opaque in-memory cookie, idle timeout 12 hours, absolute lifetime 7 days. Restarting the process logs every browser out.
- Cookie: `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` by default. Production must use HTTPS.
- CSRF: authenticated browser writes require the Session CSRF token and a same-origin `Origin` or `Referer`.

Generate a hash without placing the plaintext password in shell history:

```sh
go run . hash-password
# or
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/jordibrouwer/nextdash:latest hash-password
```

> **Breaking upgrade:** deployments created before this authentication change will exit at startup until the administrator hash is configured. See [UPGRADING.md](UPGRADING.md).

### Browser extension Write Token

`NEXTDASH_WRITE_TOKEN` is no longer a substitute for browser login. It is an optional, separate credential only for the bundled browser extension. When configured, the extension may read pages/categories/bookmarks, add bookmarks or Inbox items, request previews, and save URL icons. It cannot access the Dashboard, settings, backups, imports, reset, maintenance health APIs, or other administrator endpoints.

Paste the same value in **extension Settings → Write token**. If the server token is missing or the extension value does not match, the extension reports an authentication configuration error. Logged-in Dashboard writes continue to send this token as a second protection layer when it is configured.

Uploaded public assets under `/data/` are also restricted: only allowlisted icon, favicon, and font files can be fetched. JSON data, backups, logs, ZIP files, temporary files, subdirectories, and directory listings are never served.

**Do not expose plain HTTP to the public internet.** Put the service behind Caddy, Cloudflare Tunnel/Access, nginx, Traefik, or another HTTPS reverse proxy. A private VPN such as Tailscale remains a good additional boundary.

### Optional CORS allowlist (LAN / VPS / extension)

By default, bookmark API responses send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` so the browser extension and cross-origin tools work without extra config.

Set `NEXTDASH_CORS_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated allowlist when you want to restrict cross-origin reads/writes, for example:

```bash
NEXTDASH_CORS_ORIGINS=https://dash.example.com,chrome-extension://your-extension-id
```

Only matching `Origin` headers receive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` in the response. Unset or empty keeps the default `*`.

### Activity log (bookmark events)

Structured JSON activity lines are written to the server log for bookmark mutations and status checks by default. Opens are off unless enabled.

```bash
# Default: mutate + status + security (opens off)
NEXTDASH_ACTIVITY_LOG=mutate,status,open   # include opens
NEXTDASH_ACTIVITY_LOG=off                  # disable all activity logs

# Optional rotating file under the data directory
NEXTDASH_ACTIVITY_LOG_PERSIST=1
NEXTDASH_ACTIVITY_LOG_FILE=/path/to/activity.log   # optional; default data/activity.log

# Optional security events (auth denied, rate limits)
NEXTDASH_ACTIVITY_LOG=mutate,status,security
```

Example log line:

```text
activity: {"ts":"2026-07-03T12:00:00Z","event":"bookmark.add","pageId":1,"name":"GitHub","url":"https://github.com","source":"dashboard"}
```

Status pings are deduplicated for the same URL + result for 10 minutes unless `refresh=1` is passed to `/api/ping`. URLs appear in logs — treat log files as sensitive on shared hosts.

### Rate limits (outbound & SSRF APIs)

Optional per-IP limits on server-initiated fetches and user-triggered SSRF-sensitive endpoints:

```bash
NEXTDASH_OUTBOUND_REQUESTS_PER_MIN=120   # preview, ping, favicon, auto-heal (default 120)
NEXTDASH_SSRF_API_RATE_PER_MIN=60        # /api/bookmark-preview, /api/ping, icon uploads (default 60)
```

When exceeded, the API returns **429** and (if enabled) logs a `security` activity event.

### Content-Security-Policy

nextDash sends a restrictive CSP on HTML pages by default. Set `NEXTDASH_CSP=off` only when a reverse proxy or custom integration requires it.

### Analytics & privacy

nextDash can record **anonymous, privacy-friendly usage statistics** through a self-hosted [Umami](https://umami.is) instance at `stats.nextdash.cc`. It is **opt-in**: off until you turn it on, and nothing is measured before then.

On a fresh install a card offers **Turn on**, **What is recorded?**, or **No thanks**. Upgrading does not change a setting you already made — if you had analytics on, it stays on.

#### Turn it on or off

**Config → Behavior → Privacy** → tick or clear **Privacy-friendly analytics**. It applies after the page reloads.

From the keyboard: press <kbd>:</kbd> and run **`:telemetry on`** (or `:telemetry off`). Typing `:telemetry` on its own shows the current state. It writes the same setting and reloads the page for you.

#### Disable it for the whole instance

Set the environment variable **`DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true`** to switch analytics off server-wide, regardless of what any user has configured:

```yaml
environment:
  - DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true
```

The tracker is then never emitted, the setting cannot be turned back on through the API or the `:telemetry` command, and the **Privacy** checkbox in config renders disabled with a note explaining why. `:telemetry` shows a single row saying it is off for this server, rather than an **on** option that could not take effect. Accepts `true`, `1`, `yes`, or `on`; unset or `false` leaves analytics under user control.

Each user's own preference is left stored and untouched, so it returns exactly as it was if you ever unset the variable.

When it is off, the tracker script is **not emitted into the page at all** — it is never even downloaded, and **no request leaves your machine**. There is no client-side flag quietly suppressing calls; the code simply is not there. The choice is stored per user in `settings.json` as `analyticsOptIn`, so it follows you across devices.

#### Why it exists

nextDash was built without any picture of how it is actually used. Which views do people open? Does anyone use finders, the tag cloud, or the inbox? Where do people abandon the add-bookmark form? Without answers, every decision about what to build, fix, or remove is guesswork.

These statistics exist to answer exactly that — **which features get used, and what can be improved** — and nothing else. They are explicitly **not** for following individual users. The measurement is abstract and technical: flow through the app and feature usage, aggregated across everyone.

#### What is measured

- **Page views** — the dashboard, config, health, and colors pages.
- **Views and navigation** — opening the health and inbox views, switching dashboard pages (by position, never by name), which config tab you land on, and use of the `<` dashboard↔config shortcut. Within config, which of the eight **sections** you open, which **sub-tab** you land on and whether you got there by click or by arrow key, and whether an overview *needs attention* row was followed.
- **Settings changes** — the **name** of the setting you changed, never what you typed into it. Toggles also report `true`/`false`, since on/off is the whole point of measuring one and cannot identify anyone. Free-text fields — dashboard title, webhook URL, custom text — report the name alone, and search boxes are not reported at all.
- **List shape in health and inbox** — which filter or sort you picked, and whether you used a summary tile or a filter pill. The search box in either view is never reported.
- **Overlays** — opening search, commands, finders, the cheat sheet, the tag cloud, what's-new, and the add-bookmark form.
- **Bookmark opens** — the fact that one was opened and where from (`dashboard`, `search`, or `recent`).
- **Commands** — which command palette command was run, by its name (`theme`, `config`, `density`, …). Only names from the built-in command list are recorded; anything else you typed is discarded.
- **Bookmark maintenance** — starting an edit and saving it (with whether that was on the dashboard or in config), deleting, moving to another category (with a bucketed count, so a bulk move counts once), and reordering by drag.
- **Outcomes** — whether adding a bookmark succeeded, or hit a duplicate, shortcut conflict, validation error, or failure. This shows where the form trips people up.
- **Inbox and health actions** — snooze, mark-read, wake, promote, delete, and bulk clean-ups; health rechecks, retest-all, redirect detection, title refresh, and delete.
- **A settings snapshot** — once per page load, which features you have switched on (theme, layout preset, columns, packed columns, inbox, health view, status checks, smart collections, weather, and similar), as plain booleans and small enums. It carries the **release you are running** (`v2026.09.2`), so adoption can be read per version — without it a default that changed between releases looks like a gradual drift rather than the switch it was. The version is the published release tag, not your hostname, install or machine.

#### What is never measured

No bookmark names, URLs, search queries, page or category names, notes, or tags. No cookies are set, no personal profile is built, and there is no tracking across other websites. Counts that could identify a specific setup are bucketed (for example `2-5` rather than an exact number), and the instance is self-hosted, so nothing is shared with an advertising network.

The tracker loads from `stats.nextdash.cc`, which is allow-listed in the CSP (`script-src` and `connect-src`).

### DNS rebinding (IP pinning)

Outbound HTTP(S) dials pin resolved public IPs for ~2 minutes so a hostname cannot switch to a private address between the safety check and the connection (unless **allow localhost bookmarks** is enabled).

### Startup validation

On boot, nextDash validates the mandatory administrator Argon2id hash, `NEXTDASH_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE`, `PORT` (1–65535, default `8080`), and that `NEXTDASH_DATA_DIR` exists and is writable. Invalid config exits with a clear error before listening.

### Production Docker example

`docker-compose.prod.yml` serves CSS/JS from the embedded binary (only `./data` is mounted). As of **v2026.08.02** the production image ships only the Go binary (~40% smaller), sets a 256 MB memory cap, and caches hot server paths (parsed templates, store reads, precomputed asset hashes). Since **v2026.08.02.1** the entrypoint starts as root for host Docker hooks, then runs the app as `nextdash` (`NEXTDASH_RUN_AS_ROOT=1` optional). Optional TLS and long-cache static serving: `docker compose -f docker-compose.proxy.yml up -d` with `deploy/Caddyfile`.

Recommended LAN/VPS environment block:

```yaml
environment:
  PORT: "8080"
  NEXTDASH_ADMIN_USERNAME: admin
  NEXTDASH_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH: ${NEXTDASH_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH:?Set it in .env}
  NEXTDASH_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE: "1"
  NEXTDASH_WRITE_TOKEN: ${NEXTDASH_WRITE_TOKEN:-}
  NEXTDASH_CORS_ORIGINS: https://dash.example.com,chrome-extension://your-extension-id
  NEXTDASH_ACTIVITY_LOG: mutate,status,security
  NEXTDASH_ACTIVITY_LOG_PERSIST: "1"
  # Optional tuning:
  # - NEXTDASH_OUTBOUND_REQUESTS_PER_MIN=120
  # - NEXTDASH_SSRF_API_RATE_PER_MIN=60
  # - NEXTDASH_CSP=off
  # - NEXTDASH_DISABLE_PREFETCH=1
```

`GET /version` returns build metadata (version, commit). `GET /api/data-revision` returns a hash so open dashboard tabs detect bookmark/settings changes without a full reload.

## Features

### Keyboard-first workflow

**Navigation**
- `0` — open **Inbox** (when search is closed)
- `Shift + I` — open **Inbox** view directly (recommended; `0` still works)
- `1–9` — jump directly to a bookmark page tab
- `Shift + ←/→` — cycle between page tabs (plain arrows move bookmarks only, not pages)
- `Shift + H` — open **Health** view directly (inside dashboard)
- `,` — page overview: all pages with bookmark counts (`Tab` / `Shift+Tab` move between rows; arrow keys do not affect bookmarks behind the overlay); same modal from the **pages** grid icon in the header (evenly spaced with inbox, health, and config)
- `<` — open **config** (`<` is `Shift+,`); in config, `<` returns to the dashboard, confirming first if there are unsaved changes
- `↑/↓/←/→` — move bookmark selection (first arrow key starts navigation); `1–9` page switch also selects the first visible bookmark; mouse hover softens the stale keyboard highlight until your next keypress; on **Modern**, keyboard-selected rows use a full-row accent fill
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` — step linearly through all bookmarks when one is already selected
- `G + 1–9` — jump to the nth category or smart collection and select its first bookmark (hold `G` ~300 ms, or press `G` then a digit; a **quick tap** on `G` opens bookmark shortcuts starting with `G` instead)
- `G + P` — jump to the first pinned bookmark on the page (hold `G` or `G` then `P`)
- `GG` — jump to the very first bookmark (second `G` while the chord is pending)
- `Ctrl + Home` / `Ctrl + End` — first / last bookmark on the page (`Cmd` on Mac)
- `Enter` / `Space` — open the focused bookmark (middle-click also counts toward open stats and smart collections)
- `Esc` — clear selection, close overlay, or undo an unsaved drag reorder (before the 1s save completes)

**Blocking overlays** — While search (`>`), the cheat sheet (`!` / `F1`), recent bookmarks (`*`), tag cloud (`/`), page overview (`,`), quick-add omnibox (`&`), quick-move/delete/tag popovers (`Shift+M` / `Shift+D` / `Shift+T`), inline edit (`;`), or an app modal is open, keyboard focus stays inside that overlay (`Tab` cycles within it) and the bookmark grid behind it is `inert` (not clickable). With an **active tag filter**, only the filtered bookmark list is `inert` — the filter banner and bulk toolbar stay interactive while the tag cloud is open. Closing the overlay restores mouse and keyboard access to the grid; quick-move/delete/tag popovers also restore the keyboard highlight on the same bookmark row.

**Bookmarks**
- `+` — open the full new-bookmark modal (dashboard only, when no input is focused)
- `&` — quick-add omnibox: type `name | url | shortcut` in one line
- `Ctrl + Shift + A` — same full new-bookmark modal from anywhere
- `Ctrl + V` — paste a URL on the dashboard: choose **Save to Inbox** or open the new-bookmark modal (blocked while inline edit or the tag word cloud is open; default under General → *Paste URL default*)
- `;` — inline-edit the focused bookmark
- `Shift + M` — *Move to…* quick-move popover: choose a category or page with arrow keys
- `Shift + T` — *Quick tag* popover beside the focused bookmark: `↑`/`↓` navigate ranked tags; `Enter`/`Space` toggle a tag and advance to the next; `✓` shows tags already on the bookmark
- `Shift + D` — quick-delete popover with undo in the toast
- `Shift + C` — *Checking* popover beside the focused bookmark: choose **Off**, **Periodic**, or **Monitor** with `o` / `p` / `m`, or arrow to one and press `Enter`
- `Ctrl + C` / `Cmd + C` — copy the URL of the focused bookmark (row flashes green)
- `[` — toggle the hover preview card on the focused bookmark
- `Delete` — delete the focused bookmark
- `x` / `X` — tick the focused bookmark and advance / tick its whole category. `Shift + ↑`/`↓` extends a range, `Ctrl/Cmd + A` takes everything on screen, and `Ctrl+click` / `Shift+click` do the same with the mouse. A toolbar appears with **Move**, **Open**, **Copy links** and **Delete**, matching the entries the right-click menu gains; `Esc` clears the selection. A plain click with a selection open clears it rather than opening a bookmark

**Search & commands**
- `>` — open search; empty state shows recent queries and saved searches as chips; `←`/`→` select a chip, `Enter` applies it
- `/` — fuzzy search; ranked by prefix → word-boundary → substring; also matches URL domain, tags, and note text
- `:` — command palette (lone `:` from the dashboard); **5 collapsible groups** (**Bookmarks**, **Search & navigate**, **Look & layout**, **Smart collections**, **Settings & tools**) — click a header to expand; **recent commands** appear at the top when you reopen lone `:`; toggles refresh in place with `(on)`/`(off)` or `✓` after `Enter` (no toasts). In an open `>` search with text already typed, `:` inserts filter syntax (`category:`, `tag:`, …) instead of switching modes
- `?` — finders (e.g. `?g query` to search Google)
- `*` — recent bookmarks panel
- `! or F1` — keyboard cheat sheet (filterable with a type-to-search input; blocked while page overview `,` is open)
- `category:` / `tag:` / `page:` / `status:` — filter directly in the search bar; autocomplete suggests values after each prefix (single **Filters** group)
- `:goto <url-or-domain>` — navigate to a URL or bare domain (e.g. `:goto github.com`); `:goto config` / `stats` / `health` for quick navigation
- `:new` — open new-bookmark modal (same as `+` / `Shift+B` / `Ctrl+Shift+A`)
- `:add` — quick-add omnibox (same as `&`)
- `:note` — edit the note of the focused bookmark
- `:move` / `:edit` / `:copy` / `:quicktag` (`:qt`) — move, inline edit, copy URL, or open quick-tag popover (`Shift+T`) on the keyboard-selected bookmark
- `:pin` / `:unpin` — toggle pin on the keyboard-selected bookmark
- `:tag` — list tags; `:tag <name>` or `:tag:<name>` browse bookmarks by tag in the command palette only (dashboard unchanged); `:tag +name` / `:tag -name` add or remove on the keyboard-selected bookmark
- `:category` / `:cat` — jump to a category or smart collection by number or name
- `:filter <tag>` / `:filter clear` — apply or clear dashboard tag filter (OR logic, same as tag cloud)
- `/` (desktop, tag cloud on) — open tag word cloud on dashboard; toggle one or more tags (OR match); bulk toolbar stays clickable while the cloud is open; filtered bookmarks stack vertically; with an active filter the cloud anchors beside the `/` FAB
- `:open all` — open all bookmarks on the current page in new tabs
- `:open pinned` — open pinned bookmarks on the current page
- `:open tag <name>` / `:open category <name>` — open bookmarks matching tag or category on the current page
- `:open last [n]` — open the N most recently opened bookmarks on the current page (default 5, max 50; same 15-tab safe cap as `:open all`)
- `:page` — switch page by name or number (palette stays open, `✓` on current)
- `:recent` / `:overview` / `:cheat` / `:whatsnew` / `:reload` — recent modal (`*`), page overview (`,`), cheat sheet, what's new, reload dashboard
- `:inbox` / `:inbox triage` — open Inbox page (`Shift + I`) or start triage on unread items
- `:config [section]` — open config or a tab (`bookmarks`, `backups`, `stats`, …)
- `:remove` — delete the focused bookmark
- `:sort <method>` — per focused category: `order` / `az` / `recent` (palette shows the category name)
- `:stale [days]` — list stale bookmarks; optional day window (e.g. `:stale 7`)
- `:duplicate` / `:duplicates` — list bookmarks with duplicate URLs (opens health duplicates view)
- `:health [filter]` — open health view — `broken`, `duplicate`, `stale`, `refresh`, …; `:health page [n]` opens health with a page context
- `:monitor` — how many bookmarks are being checked; `:monitor off` stops checking all of them, `:monitor on` opens the never-checked list where the bulk enable lives
- `:dark` / `:title` / `:lang` / `:animations` / `:status` / `:opacity` — display and theme toggles
- `:collections` — toggle smart collections (today, recent, stale, most used)
- `:backup` / `:export` — open config backups or download a ZIP backup
- `:metadata` — health missing previews or config bookmarks
- `:layout <preset>` — `default` / `compact` / `cards` / `masonry` / `list` / `launcher` …
- `:theme <name>` — switch colour theme
- `:density <mode>` — `comfortable` / `compact` / `dense`
- `:columns <n>` — set column count (1–6)
- `@` — global search across all pages at once; each result shows the page name as context
- `:find <text>` — hide tiles whose name or URL don't match; `:find clear` removes the filter
- `:buttonbar <position>` — move the button bar: `bottom` / `bottom-left` / `bottom-right` / `side-left` / `side-right`
- `:save` / `:saved` — save current query / show saved searches

**Config view**
- `Shift+S` or `<` (`Shift+,`) — open config from the dashboard
- `Esc` — close config and return to the dashboard (dismisses an open modal, search or tag cloud first)
- `←`/`→` — previous/next sub-tab, wrapping at both ends
- `Home` / `End` — first / last sub-tab

> This section describes what nextDash does today.

#### Config (for self-hosters)

**Where things live** — config is a view inside the dashboard at `/#config`, opened with **`Shift+S`**, **`<`**, or the header link, and closed with **`Escape`**. Reopening it restores the **last section and sub-tab** you were on; a deep link like `/#config/behavior/privacy` still wins. It has eight sections: **Overview**, **Pages & tags**, **Bookmarks**, **Appearance**, **Behavior**, **Data & backups**, **Statistics**, and **Help**. Sections with sub-tabs are addressable too — `/#config/behavior/privacy` opens Behavior on Privacy — so a link to any setting can be shared.

The settings a self-hoster reaches for most: **Behavior → General** (localhost & private-network bookmarks, HyprMode, session tips), **Behavior → Privacy** (analytics), **Behavior → Status & health** (background rechecks, downtime webhook), and **Data & backups** (backup, restore, import/export, the **Trash** — deleted bookmarks stay recoverable for 30 days — and **Reset**, each on its own sub-tab).

**Saving** — most settings save the moment you change them and confirm with a short *Saved* message. The bookmark editor is the exception: it collects edits and writes them on **Save**.

**Phone vs tablet** — every config section is reachable at any width; content stacks and controls reflow on narrow screens. Phones (≤768px) still use the reduced dashboard footer (**Search** + **+ Bookmark** only).

**ℹ and ↺** — many controls carry an **ℹ** explaining the setting and a **↺** restoring its default.

**Keyboard** — sub-tab strips follow the ARIA tabs pattern: **`←`/`→`** move and wrap, **`Home`**/**`End`** jump to the ends. Explanations behind **ℹ** are localised (EN / NL / DE / FR / ZH-CN / ZH-TW).

**Branding & PWA** — Custom title and favicon under Advanced → Branding apply to the browser tab, the web app manifest (`/manifest.webmanifest`), and “Add to Home Screen” / installed PWA name and icon. **Advanced → HyprMode** includes an **Add to home screen** panel with platform steps and a browser install button when available.

In-app help: Config → Help tab → *General settings* (same content, translated).

### Search filters

Type these directly in the search bar (`>` mode, or after opening search). Expand **Filters** in the empty state or start typing a prefix for autocomplete:

- `category:` — filter by category name
- `status:online` / `status:offline` / `status:broken` / `status:ok`
- `status:pinned` / `status:unpinned` / `status:checked` / `status:unchecked`
- `page:current` / `page:all` / `page:2`
- `tag:name` — filter by tag

Partial values (e.g. `status:on`) keep showing suggestions until the filter is complete. `status:online` uses persisted reachability on monitored bookmarks, not only the live status cache.

### Organisation

- Unlimited pages and categories
- Drag-and-drop reorder within and between categories (drag strip on the left); saves debounce 1s with a success toast on the dashboard; bulk tag-filter move/delete groups rapid toasts into one message
- **Per-category sort** — **A–Z** and **Rec** chips in each category header (including *Other* and unknown-category blocks); click an active chip again for manual order; `:sort` in the command palette; legacy global sort removed from Config → General
- **Config → pages** and **config → categories** — drag or **↑/↓** to reorder; auto-save after ~600 ms with a localized sync toast; pages support **archive** (hide without deleting bookmarks); **Usage** column with popularity bar + bookmark count (Tags-style tier styling)
- **Config → tags** (desktop) — popularity-scaled word cloud (dashboard-style), structured list with usage bars, sorted by bookmark count; scrolls with the page; global rename/merge/delete; drill-down with **Open**; filter + clear; auto-save with undo; **↑/↓** moves focus between tag rows
- **Config → finders** (desktop) — filter list; drag or **↑/↓** reorder with auto-save; usage stats on tab open; stable ids + duplicate shortcut guard
- Long-press a bookmark row (~500 ms) to open inline edit — nearly opaque panel with a full-page blur behind it (including the launcher preset); **Save** / **Ctrl+Enter** persists immediately on the dashboard; **Esc** cancels; edits and deletes from **smart-collection** rows sync to the category column and global bookmark store; page switches confirm before discarding unsaved edits; swipe and **Ctrl+V** paste are blocked while the editor is open
- Press and hold a category header (~500 ms, not on sort buttons) to rename it — double-click still works
- Double-click a page tab to rename it — also set an emoji icon and a colour dot per page
- Collapsible categories with optional always-collapsed default
- Tags on bookmarks with autocomplete; filter by tag in search and collections

### Inbox

- **Inbox** (`/#inbox`, `Shift + I`, or `:inbox`) — a holding area for links worth keeping before you know where they belong. Paste a URL on the dashboard and it lands here, becomes a bookmark, or asks you which, depending on **Config → Behavior → Search & inbox**; the browser extension saves here too, and a URL already in the inbox is turned away rather than duplicated. Items live in `data/inbox.json`
- Filter **All** / **Unread** / **Snoozed** / **With note**, filter by site, search, and sort newest, oldest, title or site — oldest-first is how a backlog actually clears, since the links you have been avoiding are at the bottom. Every filter carries its own count, and a sentence under the toolbar says what the active filter selects; the **ℹ** beside **Triage** explains what read and unread track, what snoozing hides, and what promoting leaves behind. Filter, sort, search and site all appear in the address bar, so any view can be bookmarked or shared
- **Snooze** a link (`z`: 3 hours, tomorrow, the weekend, next week, or a date of your own) and it is hidden until it wakes — left out of every count, tile and filter except **Snoozed**, so the numbers above the list always describe what is actually waiting for you. **Wake now** brings one back early
- **Promote** (`p`) opens the full bookmark form pre-filled, with every page and category available; the inbox entry goes once the bookmark is saved. **Triage** (`t`, or `:inbox triage`) walks the list one link at a time without the mouse: `j`/`k` move, `o` open, `p` promote, `r` keep, `d` delete, `Esc` close
- Tick rows to mark read, snooze or delete just those; **Mark all read** and **Clear read** act on the whole list, and **Clear read** leaves snoozed links alone. Export the filtered list as CSV or JSON. Long lists load further rows as you scroll
- Toggle under **Config → Behavior → Search & inbox → Enable Inbox**; unread items show a badge on the Inbox tab

### Smart collections

Dynamic bookmark groups that appear automatically:

- **Today** — bookmarks matching your work/evening/weekend keyword sets
- **Recently opened** — bookmarks you've opened lately
- **Most used** — your highest open-count bookmarks
- **Stale** — bookmarks you haven't visited in a while
- **Tag collections** — one group per tag, shown when a tag has enough entries

### Appearance

- 57+ built-in theme families, dark and light variants (including Terminal Amber, Dusk Horizon, Moss & Stone, Candy Pop, Midnight Ink, Bio Abyss, Sea Glass, and fifteen more added in v2026.07.26)
- **Random theme** — pick a different built-in theme on each page refresh or each view change (bookmarks ↔ config ↔ inbox ↔ health); auto dark mode limits the pool to matching variants (`Config → Appearance`)
- Custom theme editor (`config#colors`) — dark/light default palettes, **packaged themes** subtab (edit built-in families), custom theme list with **export/import** and **undo**; live preview on palette cards with contrast warnings; on mobile the editor is read-only (viewer mode)
- Auto dark mode — follows system light/dark without overwriting your saved theme palette id
- Layout presets: Default, Compact, Cards, Terminal-ish, Masonry, Detailed List, **Launcher** (large favicon tiles)
- **Show favicons** — toggle bookmark favicons in **Config → General → Bookmarks** or with `:favicons on/off` on the dashboard
- Launcher layout preset — switch via **Config → General → Layout** or `:layout launcher` in search; icon size configurable (small / normal / large)
- Button bar position: center-bottom (default), corner dock (bottom-left / bottom-right), or a vertical side rail on either edge (side-left / side-right) via Config or `:buttonbar`
- ★ What's New star button in the corner opposite the button bar — always visible; latest release loads first; scroll for up to **50 recent versions** (each loads on demand)
- Font presets: Source Code Pro, JetBrains Mono, IBM Plex Mono, Inter, IBM Plex Sans, DM Sans, System UI
- Adjustable columns (1–6), font size, font weight, background opacity, and density
- Optional hover preview cards (off by default) — enable in **Config → General → Advanced → Bookmarks**; configurable hover delay
- Background image or gradient support
- Clickable date/time header showing a week-overview popover; optional calendar URL link

### Monitoring & health

- Real-time online/offline status with ping timings per bookmark
- **Health view** (`/#health`) — dashboard-first health triage with summary tiles, quick filters, search, sort, retest, row score breakdown, and keyboard-first navigation (`j`/`k`, `Tab`, `g`/`G`, `Home`/`End`, `s`, `p`, `f`, `x`, `m`, `c`, `Enter`, `o`, `R`/`?` to reload the cached report). Every row also shows **when you last opened it** (*just opened*, *yesterday*, *3d ago*, then a date) in a **right-aligned column** beside the domain. Share or deep-link a single row with `?hv_id=pageId:index`. The panel head shows **% healthy** and the active filter trail (`health › broken`) below the title, like Config subpages. Per-row overflow actions include **detect redirect**, **refresh title**, **archive**, and delete, reachable from the **More** button, `m`, or by **right-clicking the row** — which opens the same menu at the cursor. Edit opens the dashboard inline editor. Reach a row from the other direction with **Show in Health** in the dashboard right-click menu or the Config → Bookmarks row menu. Optional server-side background rechecks under Config → General → Status monitoring. On the **Monitored** filter, **Export history** downloads the individual up/down checks behind an uptime percentage as CSV — one row per check with timestamp, ping time and HTTP status — where the ordinary **Export** gives the current state of each bookmark; that one also carries interval, uptime and response times when the list holds monitored rows. A sentence under the toolbar says what the active filter selects, the **ℹ** beside it explains how the score, the tiles and the uptime figures are arrived at, and the header names how old the cached report is. Legacy `/health` URLs redirect into this view. The header Health entry is always available.

- **Uptime monitoring** — set a bookmark to **Monitor** and it is checked on its own interval (5 minutes to 24 hours, default 15) with 30 days of history behind it, giving an uptime percentage over 24h / 7d / 30d, a heartbeat bar, a response-time sparkline, and an outage list with durations and causes. Open the whole picture at full size with **⤢** on the row or `i` — a large response-time chart with min/average/max, the three uptime windows side by side, interval, last check, and the complete outage list. Change a row's mode from the health view (`c`), the dashboard right-click menu, or `Shift + C`; a filtered list can be switched in bulk after confirming the count. A monitored bookmark shows its status on the dashboard like a periodic one, and **Config → Behavior → Status & health** decides how much it stands out: only when something is down (default), always with its own accent edge, or never. Optional downtime webhook under Config → General, alerting after N consecutive failures (default 3) and again on recovery. The same alerts can go to your **browser** instead, arriving while nextDash is closed — allow notifications once per device from the dashboard card or Config → Behavior → Status & health. That needs HTTPS: Safari and every browser on iPhone and iPad refuse notifications over `http://localhost`. The interval is changeable from the row itself once a bookmark is monitored, and an uptime percentage carries the number of checks behind it — *100%* from three checks is a weaker claim than *100%* from three hundred. History lives in `data/health-history.json`, pruned to 30 days and 2000 samples per URL.
- **The collection, not just the row** — the **Monitored** filter opens with the whole set at once: pooled uptime over 24h / 7d / 30d, how many monitors are responding now, the average response time, the least available monitors, anything measurably slower than the week before, and every recorded outage newest first. Uptime pools individual checks rather than averaging per-monitor percentages, so a monitor with three recorded checks cannot outweigh one with three thousand. The health header also draws the share of healthy bookmarks over time, on a fixed 0–100 scale, one point per day for 90 days in `data/health-trend.json` — days you did not open the dashboard leave a gap rather than a straight line through them
- Health badge on the dashboard and config headers: compact count-only pill (e.g. `3`) with theme accent colours for broken vs warnings; refreshes about once a minute while you stay on bookmarks or Inbox (Health keeps its own live refresh on the Monitored filter); screen readers get a full `aria-label`; bulk open broken links asks for confirmation with a per-batch limit
- Filter, sort, and search state in the health view persists across page refreshes (sessionStorage) and syncs to URL query parameters (`hv_filter`, `hv_sort`, `hv_q`, `hv_id` for a selected row)
- Favicon display and refresh from the health view (per row)
- **Config → stats** (desktop) — insights block, finder usage, period filters with honest lifetime-open labels, **week-over-week** comparison on Activity when the week period is selected, **Refresh** / **Export CSV**, global table filter, row click opens bookmark editor, mobile chip-nav, formatted **Last backup** on overview; conflicts link to health

### Bookmarks

- Metadata auto-fetch (title, description, preview image) when adding a URL
- Hover preview card (opt-in) shows full URL, open count, and last-opened date when enabled in config
- Flash animation on bookmark open — subtle ripple confirms the action was registered
- Plain-text notes per bookmark — visible on the dashboard, in hover previews, and editable via command bar (`:note`), inline edit, or the config detail panel
- Open-count badge tracking usage per bookmark
- **Share** a bookmark from the right-click menu, or from a row's **More** menu in the health view — hands its name and URL to the system share sheet. Sharing needs a **secure context**, and **Safari on macOS refuses it over plain `http://`, `localhost` included**; use **HTTPS** (reverse proxy or Tailscale) for a real sheet. Chrome and Firefox on macOS/Linux have no Web Share at all. Where a sheet cannot open, the entry copies `name — URL`, says so, and re-labels itself **Copy name + URL**
- Pin bookmarks to keep them at the top of their category (no pin badge on dashboard rows; use `:pin` / inline edit)
- Import from browser HTML export (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) — folders become categories, duplicate URLs skipped; **missing icons are batch-fetched with a progress bar**
- Export all bookmarks to CSV (localized headers: Name, URL, Category, Page, Shortcut, Tags, Notes)
- Full ZIP backup and restore (pages, bookmarks, categories, **finders**, settings, themes, `data/icons/`, custom favicon/font); atomic import with orphan cleanup — **finders preserved** when omitted from ZIP; **last backup date** shown in Config → Backups; after restore, missing bookmark icons are prefetched the same way
- Settings-only **export/import** of `settings.json` (migration-safe) from Config → Backups
- Bookmark icons: upload, URL fetch, link-preview fetch; re-upload **overwrites** same filename

### Notifications

- Toast notifications with undo support
- Configurable toast duration

## Mouse gestures

| Gesture | Action |
|---|---|
| Right-click a bookmark | Actions in one place: open in new tab, copy URL, **share**, edit, tags, move, availability checking, **select** / **select all in category**, delete (`Shift` + right-click gives the browser's own menu). Right-clicking a bookmark inside an open selection switches the menu to the whole selection, with the count named |
| Drag the left strip of a bookmark | Reorder within category or move to another category |
| Long press a bookmark row (~500 ms) | Open inline edit (save with **Save** or **Ctrl+Enter**) |
| Hover over a bookmark | Show preview card when enabled (Config → General → Advanced → Bookmarks) |
| Long press a category header (~500 ms) | Rename the category (not on sort buttons; double-click still works) |
| Double-click a page tab | Rename the page |

## Browser Extension

The **nextDash Bookmark Saver** extension (`extension/`) lets you save the current browser tab directly to a nextDash page.

### Install (Chrome / Chromium)

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `extension/` folder from this repository

### First-time setup

1. Click the extension icon
2. Open the **Settings** tab
3. Enter your nextDash server URL (e.g. `http://localhost:8080`)
4. The extension requires `NEXTDASH_WRITE_TOKEN`; paste the same value under **Write token**
5. Choose a default page and save

### Save tab

- Pre-filled title and URL; optional **shortcut** (auto-suggested from the name when left empty)
- Pick page/category, tags, and note — or **Save to Inbox** for a quick capture without choosing a page
- Duplicate URL warning; **409** when the shortcut is already taken on that page
- If a dashboard tab is open on the same server, it may toast and refresh

When you restrict CORS with `NEXTDASH_CORS_ORIGINS`, include your extension origin (`chrome-extension://…` from `chrome://extensions`).

See `extension/README.md` for full usage and development notes.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome — bugs, features, and translations alike.

### Branch workflow

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **`dev`** | Day-to-day development (tests, CI, scripts) |
| **`main`** | Published release for Docker and the public repo page |

1. Branch from **`dev`**, make changes, and open pull requests **into `dev`**.
2. CI runs on pushes and PRs to **`dev`**.
3. When a release is ready, merge **`dev` → `main`** with:

   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   ./scripts/release-to-main.sh v2026.07.02
   ```

   That script merges, strips dev-only files from `main` (tests, Playwright, internal scripts), tags the release, pushes, and publishes a **GitHub Release** (sidebar “Latest”) via [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/).

   **One-time setup:** `brew install gh` and `gh auth login`.

Do **not** merge `dev` into `main` manually on GitHub — the compare banner after pushing to `dev` is informational only until you run the release script.

**Clone for development:** `git clone` then `git checkout dev`.  
**Clone for Docker / stable use:** stay on the default **`main`** branch.
